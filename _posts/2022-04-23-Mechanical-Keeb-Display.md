## Project Description

Nullbits (LLC) are a US based company who produce mechanical keyboard kits. One such keyboard kit, the Nibble, is shown in the image above. The kit comes without mechanical switches or keycaps, those featured in the above image were purchased separetely (Gateron Black Inks V2, and SoulCat - To the Universe). 

An OLED display connection is featured on the PCB of the kit, allowing for the use of an OLED display. However, the standard kit requires mounting of the OLED inplace of two keys; meaning the function of said keys is lost. 

To solve this issue, I created a mount for the OLED display which allows for it's positioning at the top of the keyboard along the clear acryllic.
