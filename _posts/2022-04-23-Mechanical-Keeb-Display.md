## Project Description

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nullbits.co/"> Nullbits</a> are a US based company who produce mechanical keyboard kits. One such keyboard kit, the Nibble, is shown in the image above. The kit comes without mechanical switches or keycaps, those featured in the above image were purchased separetely (Gateron Black Inks V2, and SoulCat - To the Universe). 

An OLED display connection is featured on the PCB of the kit, allowing for the use of an OLED display. However, the standard kit requires mounting of the OLED inplace of two keys; meaning the function of said keys is lost. 

To solve this issue, I created a mount for the OLED display which allows for it's positioning at the top of the keyboard along the clear acryllic.

## Blender Model

    <figcaption> <b> Fig.1, Blender Model</b> | This image shows the blender model of the display mount which can be found on my github page, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Alex-Meek/Blender-Models/tree/main"> here</a>. The green coloured object is a rough outline of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="https://mechboards.co.uk/products/oled-screen"> oled model</a> I aquired for the keyboard. </figcaption>

As you can see in <b> fig.1</b>, the display mount is relatively simple. The display sandwiched between the uppermost two grey objects, and the wire connecting the PCB to the display is sandwiched between the two lowermost grey objects. 

The blender model can then be exported as a .stl file, which can be read by your 3D printing software and compiled into a .gcode file. I don't recall the settings I printed with, as I'm writing this many months after it's creation, but it should be relatively easy to print. I printed in PLA, and that has been a fine material for the part so far.
